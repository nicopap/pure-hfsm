//! # Pure HFSM
//!
//! A finite state machine library with a clear separation between the machine
//! definition and its changing state.
//!
//! I developed this library for my bevy project. This is why I give generic
//! lifetime parameters to `Behavior::World`, `Behavior::Update` and
//! `Transition::World` types. This requires GATs, but I found it was the only way
//! to get it to work with the horror that is `SystemParam` in bevy.
//!
//! The goal of the library is to have the state machine description be completely
//! independent from the state. From this, we get a lot of cool stuff that other
//! state machine libraries do not let you do easily or trivially, such as:
//! * Serialization and deserialization of state machines
//! * Compact representation of both the state and the descriptions
//! * Minimal mutable data, separate from the state machine. In bevy ECS, I can
//!   store it independently from the state machine, as a `Component` (while
//!   the state machines are loaded as `Asset`)
//! * Shared state machines with as many instances as you want
//!
//! There is a few downsides to know before using this library:
//! * There is more boilerplate to write to get things to work
//! * It's not type safe! However, you will get an error _when constructing_ the
//!   state machine if you are referring to non-existent states or machines
//!   in your `builder::StateMachines`! Which is far better than an error when
//!   running transitions, but still not as optimal as a compilation error.
//! * There are _three_ different `StateMachines` type you have to interact with in
//!   order to use this library (1) is the serialized representation `builder` (2)
//!   is the compact immutable description (3) is the mutable state handle or `label`.
//!
//! For the serialized representation of the state machine to still be convenient
//! and maintainable while having a compact internal representation, you will need
//! to use `builder::StateMachines` for serde interface and convert it into a
//! runnable state machine as a second step.
//!
//! ## Features that may or may not be added in the future
//!
//! - [ ] `serde` cargo feature flag to be able to compile the library without serde
//! - [ ] Better documentation
//! - [ ] A version without the `StateData` `Box<dyn Any>`
//! - [ ] Tests
//! - [ ] A visual state machine editor

//! # How to use this library
//!
//! This library is divided in three types of state machines:
//! * [`builder::StateMachines`]: A serializable description of multiple interacting state machines
//! * [`StateMachines`]: is a compact description of multiple interacting state machines
//! * [`label::NestedMachine`]: is the running state of a state machine
//!
//! You will need to first describe the state machine with
//! [`builder::StateMachines`], use it's
//! [`build`](builder::StateMachines::build) method to get a [`StateMachines`].
//!
//! You will be able to control the execution of a Hierarchical Finite State
//! Machine (aka HFSM) with the [`label::NestedMachine`], passing it
//! a [`StateMachines`] when necessary.
